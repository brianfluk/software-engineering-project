# Team 17



## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 10/13
 * Where: BA2270

## Process - Reflection

Introduction: This week was spent figuring out logistics and coming up with an initial design idea and plan. We also did some cursory  research on technologies available that would aid in setting up our system.

#### Decisions that turned out well

* After switching from a Facebook chat to slack, group communication improved with the use of slack channels to separate out conversation topics such as our standup and technology planning. 
* Task tracking will become more important as the tasks become more technical and this week we researched and found a few options for tracking tasks. Originally we were using a flat text file to track tasks but, right now the decision is to use Git projects. We also acquired a Jira license in case we need a more powerful tool, with more operating overhead. 
* The other big task for the week was coming up with an initial backlog of tasks. This helped get the team to do some research and survey target users. The decision to survey users was really helpful, we learned that a feature to help match study buddies would be desirable by students.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Finding a time that works for everyone to meet has been challenging and needs to be improved for future. We are hoping that using doodle will aid us in this endeavor.
* Currently our solution has been using slack to talk and meeting up in groups that are smaller than the whole team. Initially we thought we could meet at a certain time, but academic schedules have gotten in the way. To get around this we have been communicating on slack and in person when we pass each other in Bahen. But we rarely pass each-other in Bahen so we may need to rely on tutorials.
* Creating enough tasks for everyone in the team to do could have gone better because we are following scrum development and several roles were shared, so not everyone had a specific role or task to do.

#### Planned changes
We are planning to change the way we schedule meetings. To help with this we made a doodle where everyone put in their schedules for the week and we are discussing moving certain things to online in order to avoid issues created by lack of communication. Also we are going to try adding another in-person meeting during the week to keep everyone in sync. Originally, we planned for one meeting a week, but decided two meetings would make it easier to stay on track.

We must also take into consideration course load of other courses when deciding how much work we are going to take on. This week in particular was brutal for those taking 373.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
* The goal of setting up a slack chat was met.
* We decided on a hosting service, heroku.com because it is free and widely used. This means that there will be lots of support for issues we run into and it will be compatible with a wide variety of plugins. Hopefully this will make development simpler.
* We successfully created a process and team configuration that we think will lead to high productivity. Below is a high level description of the path our tasks will take to completion.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
* We also could not figure out a set time for weekly meetings yet due to conflicting academic schedules.
* Unfortunately since we could not meet very often we were not able to discuss or assign priority for the features of the product.

## Meeting Highlights
* Figured out that it makes sense to try and use React and node.js, since learning it will be easy, and two of our members have prior experience with them. Furthermore, it is compatible with our hosting service, Heroku.com.
* Heroku.com is the best available option for hosting, need to set it up for next sprint. 
* Github projects is our best bet for managing task backlogs.
* We need to put a more concerted effort into meeting in person and have a greater presence in the slack chat.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
