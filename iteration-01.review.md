# Team 17



## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 10/13
 * Where: BA2270

## Process - Reflection

Introduction: This week was spent figuring out logistics and coming up with an initial design idea and plans. We did some initial research on technologies available to us and set up a group chat. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

* After switching from a Facebook chat to slack, group communication improved with the use of slack channels to separate out conversation topics such as our standup and technology planning. 
* Task tracking will become more important as the tasks become more technical and this week we researched and found a few options. Right now the decision is to use Git projects, but we also acquired a Jira license in case we need a more powerful tool, with more operating overhead. 
* The other big task for the week was coming up with an initial backlog of tasks. This helped get the team to do initial research and survey target users. The decision to survey users was really helpful, we learned that a feature to help match study buddies would be desirable by students.



List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Finding a time that works for everyone to meet has been challenging and needs to be improved for future. 
* Currently our solution has been using slack to talk and meeting up in groups that are smaller than the whole team. Initially we thought we could meet at a certain time, but academic schedules have gotten in the way. To get around this we have been communicating on slack and in person when we pass each other in Bahen. 
* Creating enough tasks for everyone in the team to do could have gone better because we are following scrum development and several roles were shared, so not everyone had a specific role or task to do.

#### Planned changes
We are planning to change the way we schedule meetings. To help with this we made a doodle where everyone put in their schedules for the week and we are discussing moving certain things to online in order to avoid issues created by lack of communication. Also we are going to try adding another in-person meeting during the week to keep everyone in sync. Originally, we planned for one meeting a week, but decided two meetings would make it easier to stay on track.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
* The goal of setting up a slack chat was met. 
* We decided on a hosting service, heroku.com because it is free and widely used. This means that there will be lots of support for issues we run into and it will be compatible with a wide variety of plugins. Hopefully this will make development simpler.
* The product.md and iteration-01.plan.md were both completed. They can be found in this repo.


 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
* Initially we were a little too ambitious and had hoped to have created an initial server instance. This task was not taken on because it could have locked us down and the project was not ready yet. This task makes more sense to work on in the next two sprints. 
* We also could not figure out a set time for weekly meetings yet due to conflicting academic schedules.



 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights
* Figured out that it makes sense to try and use React and node.js, since learning it will be easy to learn, and two of our members have prior experience with them. Furthermore, it is compatible with our hosting service, Heroku.com.
* Heroku.com is the best available option for hosting, need to set it up for next sprint. 
* Github projects will be helpful in managing the project.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
