# TCHAT/Scrum Vaders

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 2 : Creating Chatrooms : 10/22/17 ~ 11/13/17

In this iteration we want to create a basic webservice that will captures the core benefits of our proposed system; connecting students together and collaborating in class.

### Process

##### Roles & responsibilities

**Product Owner:** (Raymond Gao) Acts as the products key stake holder. Ensures that the work being done lines up with the products vision and works closely with the team to design and implement needed features. As well the product owner populates and maintains the product backlog.

**Scrum Lord:** (Andrew Sabot) Manages the weekly sprints, coordinates meetings and decides what tasks from the backlog will be in each sprint. Also helps team members get past blockers and acquires the resources needed for the project. The Scrum Lord also decides what to do with tasks that overflowed from previous sprints, whether they will re-inserted into the backlog or trashed.

**Stakeholder:** (Brandon and Max) A team member who provides feedback on value generated and progress through the lens of one of our three stakeholders; students, lecturers, and course administrators.

**Architect:** (Brandon and Anas) A team member who designs the high level structure of the system.

**Developer:** (Everyone) Responsible for the creation and delivery of the system.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

We are using github projects organized with the following columns todo, review/test, done and each member of the team has a column for what tasks they currently are assigned.

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks
- Log in page for students
- view availble courses and lectures
- The lecture page with slides and chat (Future of agregating by questions??)
   -Color sort chat messages so to make the chat more readable ie questions =red, anouncment=blue, answers=green
- Store chat messages to database
- Load in chat log from database

- Create script (Some live action skit?)

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

- Heroku account running


 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
