# Team 17

 

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 10th, 2017
 * End date: October 12th, 2017

## Process

Quick introduction: We are going to be following the Agile Scrum methodologies taught in class. We will do some modifications to fit our academic schedules. This week we met up and discussed our ideas and what needs to be researched in order to move forward.

#### Roles & responsibilities

**Product Owner:** Acts as the products key stake holder. Ensures that the work being done lines up with the products vision and works closely with the team to design and implemement needed features. As well the product owner populates and maintains the product backlog.

**Scrum Lord:** Manages the weekly sprints, coordinates meetings and distributes the tasks from the backlog. Also helps team members get past blockers and aquires the resources needed for the project. The Scrum Lord also decides what to do with tasks that overflowed from previous sprints, whether they will re-inserted into the backlog or trashed.

**Stakeholder:** This role is someone who is a professor, student, or university  administrator who wants this project in their classroom and will question the importance of implementing each feature. We plan to have at least one stakeholder 

Team Members: These are the developers, they are responsible for the creation and delivery of the system.


#### Events

**Daily "Standup"**
Unfortunately due to strenuous courseloads on for some of our group members, in-person daily meetups will be impossible. Instead we will facilitate daily "chat-meets" at 10pm every day where members will discuss, blockers, progress, and plans.

---
**Review and Planning Meetings**
We decided to have our weekly Review and planning meetings back to back, so we can review our week and plan for the next week in sequence. It makes little logical sense to have the review meeting in the middle of the scrum, as things can still occur and won't be reviewed until the middle of next scrum. The meetings will take place 5pm every friday in BA2270. During this meeting we will discuss the plan for next week, assign tasks, review and improve upon our collaboration process, and touch base with stakeholders to ensure that value is being created. If possible stakeholders will demo the new features created to give feedback.

---
**Code Reviews**
Code reviews will happen when a task is completed. During a code review, at least two people, the creator of the code and the reviewer, will look over the code. The creator will explain the high level idea of the system to the reviewer. The reviewer will then determine if the code was created in a modular, maintainable and readable way. If refactoring is needed a task will be made in the product backlog. If refactoring is not needed, then tests will be written for the code. If testing does not pass a task will be made in the product backlog. Otherwise the task is considered "done".

| Event | Time | TimeScale | Location | Actions |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Standup| Daily 10pm | 10-20 mins | Slack | Discuss daily events, discuss blockers, discuss plans |
| Review and Planning Meeting | Fridays 5pm | 1-2hrs | BA2270 | Review & revise collaboration, manage completed tasks, manage backlog, plan for next week, touch base with stakeholders, evaluate value generated, demo and feedback |
| Code Reviews | spontaneous | 10mins - 1hrs | Slack | Review and test code, create "touch up" tasks if necessary, mark tasks as "done"|

#### Artifacts

 * Design document - on google drive with user cases, product description and how it will be implememented. It also contains the vision for the MVP. Outlines the vision that the product owner has.

 Define: Task
 	Has priority:
 		Priority is affected positively by # of dependants
		Priority is affected positively by MVP requiredness
		Priority is affected positively by how well it can be defined
 	Has size:
 		Scale of 1 - 5
 		1 being a few lines of code
 		5 being a complex system requiring multiple classes

 * Product backlog - it will be a priority sorted list of tasks that need to be done for the project to be completed. Smaller, more immediate tasks will be better defined. Google doc for now. As we decide how much structure is needed, we will switch into trello, jira or github projects. Priority assigned by product owner based on above definition.

 * Sprint backlog - A list of tasks that are in play for the current sprint. Assigned by scrumlord based on skillset of programmers and priority of task.

 * Completed tasks - All items completed from Sprints will go into To Test.

 * To Test â€“ All items competed here will go into Done. Else into Product backlog with higher priority.

 * Overflow tasks - All tasks in the previous sprint that was not completed. These lists will be reintegrated into the product backlog with increased priority.

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

## Product

#### Goals and tasks
Goals:
 * Come up with team workflow and roles.
 * Create an outline of how the project will be made.
 * Figure out what features to prioritize. 
 * Determine a good spot to host our project.
 * Set up a meeting
 
Tasks:
 * Talk to students and teachers about how they would use a tool like this.
 * Meet as a group and discuss possible design descisions and directions of the project.
 * Set up slack for group comunication.
 * Work on 1rst deliverable.
 * Research potetial hosting services. One such option is Heroku.

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts
* Created project.md and iteration-01.plan.md, documenting initial plans for the project.
* Created a diagram showing the development workflow.
* A slack group chat with daily messages talking about the tasks worked on and completed.
* A file with a temporary product backlog and some initial tasks that need to be completed in order to move forward.

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
