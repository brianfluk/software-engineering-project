# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 16 November 2017
 * Where: BA2270

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction
This iteration we designed a mock, designed and implemented the database and a prototype of the actual web app.
We managed to create the landing page with a signup navigation bar, login page, PDF viewer in the chatroom, 
a page for lecture materials for all the lectures and another page for all the live chatrooms.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * We decided that instead of students and instructors holding accounts, now only instructors are the only 
   users that have to sign in. This design change allows the instructors to add and delete course materials,
   add courses that they are teaching, while students are given a read only permission to the course materials
   and permission to access the chat room.
 
 * We used bootstrap for the creation of the front end. This gives us the convenience to drag and drop templates
   with a guarantee that there are no bugs and very dynamic with different window sizes.
   
 
 
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 
 * The lack of decision for commenting code resulted our javascript code becoming spagettied after the different push and commits          from different team members.  
 
 * We ended up not using our GitHub Projects structure, because all our members are very busy with other courses.
   We feel like it has a high overhead because we have limited time to update and check GitHub Projects.
 
 * The use of doodle to aid us in setting up a meeting is not very effective. We find that it was very tedious to 
   import our schedule and selecting a timeslot that works for everyone. We went back to stick with just asking
   team members in slack for the appropriate time to meet.
   
 * Our initial decision to set up heroku server ended up not being executed. We decided to run the web app locally
   for demonstration purposes. We feel like this is a better suited task for this deliverable. We plan to implement
   the heroku server for the next deliverable.
 
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
